# Execution-MuAgent — interaction flow

Execution-MuAgent is invoked programmatically by Processing-MuAgent. It never interacts with the user. This document describes the full spec → running job lifecycle.

---

## Triggered by: `execute-spec`

Processing-MuAgent calls this after it has written `site.config` and the per-stage spec.

### Step 1 — Load and validate

1. Load `site.config` → `SiteConfig` (scheduler, partition, account, QOS, container, env).
2. Load `internal/stage_meta/<stage>.yaml` → `StageSpec` (resources, inputs, outputs, progress_timeout_hint, science_description).
3. `validate_spec(spec, site_config)`:
   - Resources > 0.
   - Scheduler is supported.
   - Declared input paths exist on the filesystem.
4. On any validation error: write `spec_validation_error` finding to `internal/hpc_monitor/latest_report.md`; exit non-zero. Processing-MuAgent surfaces the error to the user.

### Step 2 — Render submission script

1. Map spec resources → scheduler header directives:
   - SLURM: `#SBATCH --cpus-per-task`, `--mem`, `--time`, `--partition`, `--account`, `--qos`
2. If `site_config.container` is set: wrap command in `apptainer exec --bind <run_dir> <container> bash <launch_runner.sh>`.
3. Write script to `internal/hpc_monitor/scripts/<stage>_<timestamp>.sh`.

### Step 3 — Submit and diagnose

1. Run `sbatch --parsable <script>`.
2. On success: capture job_id from stdout.
3. On failure:
   - **Policy rejection** (invalid partition/account, walltime over limit): write `submit_rejected_policy` finding to `latest_report.md`; exit non-zero. Processing-MuAgent reads this and tells the user what to adjust.
   - **Transient failure**: retry up to 2× with 10 s backoff. If still failing: write `submit_rejected_transient` finding; exit non-zero.

### Step 4 — Record to execution manifest

Append to `internal/hpc_monitor/execution_manifest.jsonl`:

```json
{
  "submitted_at": "2026-06-02T14:00:00Z",
  "stage": "s3_doublets",
  "science_description": "Detect and remove doublets using Scrublet (RNA) and SnapATAC2 (ATAC)",
  "job_id": "987654",
  "spec_path": ".../internal/stage_meta/s3_doublets.yaml",
  "script_path": ".../internal/hpc_monitor/scripts/s3_doublets_20260602T140000Z.sh",
  "run_dir": "/path/to/run",
  "expected_outputs": { "rna_post": "...", "atac_post": "..." }
}
```

### Step 5 — Register for monitoring

Write to `internal/hpc_monitor/submissions.jsonl` with `spec_path` and `progress_timeout_hint` fields so the watch loop uses the per-spec timeout.

### Step 6 — Monitor (if `--watch`)

Poll loop at `interval_s` (default 270 s / 4.5 min; the constant lives in `monitor.DEFAULT_CHECK_INTERVAL_S`). The monitor drives a state machine; detection and decision are always separate.

**Two clocks:**
- `interval_s` — sampling rate (how often the watcher wakes). Same for every stage.
- `tolerance_n = ceil(progress_timeout_hint_min * 60 / interval_s)` — how many consecutive quiet intervals are allowed. A heartbeat fires when any run-scoped file mtime advances OR the head log size grows.

**State machine per iteration:**

1. **Collect** — `collect_snapshot()`: scheduler state (sacct/squeue/qstat, ≤5 s), filesystem progress files, log tails, child job IDs, error markers.

1a. **Verify outputs (normal progress)** — `verify_stage_outputs()` properly verifies each per-stage spec's declared outputs that have appeared (HDF5/parquet/JSON open, or structural signature checks without those libs — not merely non-empty). The first time a stage's outputs all verify, emit a `stage_output_verified` finding. (The head-job spec is verified like any other when Processing has populated its `outputs` from the target stage — e.g. a planning `plan_review_propose` submission — so a clean head-job exit still emits this finding.) `latest_snapshot.json` is refreshed every iteration (healthy or not) and now also carries `interval_s` + `next_recheck_after_s`, so Processing's `hpc-status` never reads stale state and its re-poll cadence is data-driven.

2. **Definitive signals** (always checked, bypass silence machine):
   - `scheduler_failed` → CONFIRMED_DEAD immediately.
   - `workflow_error_marker` (Traceback, OOM, WorkflowError, …) → CONFIRMED_DEAD immediately.

2a. **Workflow-complete cleanup** (positive terminal signal, checked after definitive signals, before the watcher): if the head log shows a clean finish (a `WORKFLOW_COMPLETE_MARKER` — `steps (100%) done` / `Complete log(s):` / `Nothing to be done`) **and** there are no error markers, but the scheduler still shows the head RUNNING, the orchestrator process is **lingering** (e.g. in-process leiden/UMAP worker threads block interpreter exit). Emit a `workflow_complete` finding, cancel the **head job only** (`cancel_submission_jobs(submission, [])` — children already finished; the result is discarded so **no `kill_action` is recorded** and Processing never mis-reads a completed stage as cancelled), set health `DONE`, and let the loop exit. This frees the allocation in one check instead of burning it to walltime.

3. **Watcher** (HEALTHY / RECOVERED state): if latest_progress_file mtime or head_log size grew since last check → heartbeat, silence resets to 0. Otherwise `silence_intervals += 1`. When `silence_intervals >= tolerance_n` → SUSPECT, emit `stall_suspected` (warning only).

4. **Investigation** (SUSPECT state): gather independent evidence — `sstat` CPU/memory (SLURM), filesystem responsiveness probe (D-state detection), child storage-hang sentinel ("Storing output in storage."). Liveness is judged by **CPU activity since the last investigation** (`cpu_delta`), not absolute presence — a finished-but-lingering or deadlocked process still holds memory and cumulative CPU, so an absolute threshold would mis-read it as alive. (`sstat` MaxRSS is collected for the diagnostic report only — it is monotonic, so it can't signal idleness.) Classify by rules:
   - Scheduler failed / error markers → `confirmed_dead`
   - Child storage hang / filesystem probe timeout → `fs_hang`
   - CPU time advanced (`cpu_delta > CPU_ACTIVE_DELTA_S`, ≈1 s) → `recovered`
   - Responsive filesystem + RUNNING + a CPU sample that did **not** advance → `confirmed_dead` (now reachable for a lingering/deadlocked process)
   - No prior sample yet (`cpu_delta` `None`, first investigation) or no sstat reading → `recovered` (conservative default; establishes the baseline, so a kill needs two samples)

5. **Kill** (unhealthy verdict — CONFIRMED_DEAD or FS_HANG):
   - `cancel_submission_jobs()` — children first, then head (cleanup so Processing can resubmit).
   - Record `confirmed_dead_reason` (or `filesystem_hang`) in cancel result.
   - Write full snapshot + monitor state to `latest_snapshot.json`, including structured `findings` and `kill_action` (the full machine contract Processing-MuAgent consumes).
   - Also write a debug/audit copy to `latest_report.md` and `reports/<job_id>_<timestamp>.md` — daemon-internal only; Processing never parses these and they are never shown to the user.
   - Execution never holds for a human and never resubmits — Processing-MuAgent reads the report, escalates to the human, fixes, and resubmits.

6. **Loop exit** when no jobs are active in scheduler (all terminal states), or immediately after a terminal verdict this iteration (`DONE` from workflow-complete cleanup, or `KILLED`) — no extra sleep/re-poll.

7. **PID cleanup** — `monitor.pid` is removed in a `finally` block whether the loop exits normally, via an exception, or after a kill verdict. A missing `monitor.pid` is the signal Processing-MuAgent uses to detect that the daemon has stopped.

---

## Triggered by: `resume-monitor`

Processing-MuAgent calls this (via `supervisor-restart`) when the supervision daemon dies mid-run but the cluster job is still active. It does not submit a new job.

### Step 1 — Load submission

Read `internal/hpc_monitor/latest_submission.json` and reconstruct the `Submission` dataclass. This file is written by `execute-spec` at step 5 above and is never modified afterward.

### Step 2 — Resume watch loop

Call `monitor_watch()` with the reconstructed `Submission` object and the same parameters that would have been used by the original `execute-spec --watch` invocation (`progress_timeout_hint` from the submission record, default `interval_s=DEFAULT_CHECK_INTERVAL_S` (270)). The watch loop is identical — same state machine, same file writes, same kill logic.

### Step 3 — PID cleanup

Remove `monitor.pid` in a `finally` block, same as `execute-spec --watch`.

## Triggered by: `init-machine` / `provision-env` / `validate-env` (operator-facing)

These are the **infrastructure-ownership** commands — the exception to "never contact the user" (see system_prompt Hard rule 1). At machine-setup time there is no Processing agent and no run dir, so they print structured results to stdout and exit non-zero on error.

### `init-machine` (fresh-machine bootstrap)

The first command run on a new machine. In order:
1. `probe_capabilities()` → env manager, container runtime, scheduler, gpu_present.
2. Write `~/.muagene/machine.config` (manager, container_runtime, singularity_module, gpu_image, pinned `gpu_image_uri`, policy, `processing_repo`, env names, detected scheduler/gpu_present).
3. Provision the **CPU env** from the committed conda-lock lock (no science site.config needed — the recipe is synthesized from machine.config + `<processing-repo>/workflow/envs/manifest.yaml`).
4. `pip install --no-deps -e` **both** agent packages (Processing-MuAgent and Execution-MuAgent) into the CPU env so **login-node** `Processing-MuAgent submit` can spawn `python -m execution_muagent` from that env (`--no-deps`: the lock already supplies every dependency, so pip only links source + console scripts and never re-resolves conda packages from PyPI). Cluster **child jobs** do not need this — they import `executor` from the repo via `PYTHONPATH=$PMA_REPO_ROOT` (exported by `scripts/launch_runner.sh` and inherited through `sbatch --export=ALL`).
5. If `--device` includes gpu: **pull** the pinned image to the local `.sif` (never build). Requires `--gpu-image-uri`.
6. `validate_env` per device; print a readiness report. Fail loud on any error.

### `provision-env` / `validate-env`

Idempotent per-device make/verify. `--site-config` is optional: with it, the run's `environments:` section drives provisioning (backward compatible); without it, the recipe is synthesized from machine.config + the manifest. CPU = conda-lock create; GPU = pull a pinned image. `validate-env` import-checks the declared modules and never silently degrades.

### Failure handling (fail-loud, actionable)

- GPU image not pullable / `image_uri` missing → `gpu_image_unavailable` (CPU stays ready; no local-build fallback).
- Non-linux host with a linux-64 lock → `platform_unsupported` (never a silent cross-platform solve).
- `processing.yaml` newer than the lock → `lock_stale_vs_yaml` (run `Processing-MuAgent regenerate-locks`).
- No env manager on PATH → reported by `init-machine`/`doctor`.

## Reporting back to Processing-MuAgent

All state — including structured `findings` (list of `{severity, code, message}`) and `kill_action` — is persisted STRUCTURALLY in `internal/hpc_monitor/latest_snapshot.json`, not only rendered in `latest_report.md`. `latest_report.md` is a daemon-internal debug/audit log only. Processing-MuAgent reads `latest_snapshot.json` (via one-shot `hpc-status`):

| Finding code | Meaning | Processing-MuAgent action |
|---|---|---|
| `submit_rejected_policy` | Scheduler rejected submission (partition/account/walltime) | Relay as adjustable hint; ask user to fix site.config |
| `scheduler_failed` | Scheduler reports terminal failure state | Report to human; fix; resubmit |
| `workflow_error_marker` | Error keywords in logs (Traceback, OOM, …); `message` appends `Root cause — <child_log>: <exception> \| …` scraped from the failing child rule log | Relay the root-cause line to the human; fix; resubmit |
| `stage_output_verified` | A stage's outputs verified complete and loadable | Informational progress; continue |
| `workflow_complete` | Workflow finished cleanly but the head job was lingering; the head job was cancelled and the daemon exits | Informational — job done (not a failure); drive the next gate / completion |
| `stall_suspected` | N quiet intervals; investigation starting | Informational; no action needed |
| `stall_confirmed` | Investigation concluded confirmed dead (job killed) | Report to human; fix; resubmit |
| `stall_recovered` | Investigation found life; monitoring continues | Informational; no action needed |
| `filesystem_hang_suspected` | D-state / storage-degraded hang (job killed) | Report to human; fix; resubmit |
| `output_missing` | Declared output missing/empty/corrupt after COMPLETED | Report to human; fix; resubmit |
| Clean exit | No findings; job completed normally | Continue normal pipeline flow |

**Environment-preflight findings** (from `execute-spec` preflight, `provision-env`, `validate-env`, `init-machine`):

| Finding code | Meaning | Processing-MuAgent action |
|---|---|---|
| `env_missing` | Device env not provisioned on this machine | Relay; provisioning is auto unless policy=manual (then run the printed `provision-env`) |
| `provision_failed` | conda-lock create / image pull failed | Relay the stderr tail to the human; fix; re-run |
| `gpu_image_unavailable` | GPU `image_uri` missing or not pullable (no local-build fallback) | Relay verbatim; set/fix the registry `image_uri`, then re-run |
| `lock_stale_vs_yaml` | `processing.yaml` is newer than the lock | Relay; run `Processing-MuAgent regenerate-locks`, commit, re-run |
| `platform_unsupported` | CPU lock is linux-64 but the host is not | Relay; use a linux host or a container (MuAgene CPU env is linux-only) |
| `import_failed` | Env present but a declared module failed to import | Relay; re-provision / fix the env definition |
| `gpu_import_needs_node` (warning) | GPU imports unverifiable on a non-GPU login node | Informational; the real check runs on the GPU node |
| `env_stale` (warning) | Lock/image fingerprint drifted from what was provisioned | Informational; next submit re-provisions (policy=auto) |
